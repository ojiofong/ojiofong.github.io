A brief overview on how this site is hosted.

### Github Pages and Jekyll
* Powered by a static site generator called [Jekyll][jekyll].
* The source for this website is [hosted on Github][alexmgraham_repo].
* The beautifully simplistic theme is [jekyll-uno by Josh Gerdes][jekyll-uno].
* [Github pages][github-pages] automatically compiles and serves the static HTML pages whenever a change is uploaded.

### Costs
* Github Pages: Free!
* SSL Certificate: Free!

Overall, it costs nothing but effort to get this up and running. Join the club and convert your thoughts.toString();
